Goal: write a code journal
* First try to write a journal. looking good.I created a repo named:codejournal and added file README.md by git add . I was not able to copy link to my terminal. I asked for help from tony. Then i made some changes init checked my status  using git status and then i pushed it to github by Git push.

* i thought it worked looks like im stuck
* omg i dont know what to do
* i forgot to save the file so git did not see any changes
* yea i got it

Goal: giving a theme 
* just looked up for some basic syntax to make my journal pretty.I am hoping i don't make any mistakes there.

* forgot to save again ahhhh

Goal: working on webpage

* Just created a folder "hello"
* Added a file "index.html"
* Having some trouble adding my code in terminal
* My folder "hello" was not on my github so i was having problem
* I got help from tony
* Used git init created a repository
* Added ssh keys

Goal: working on agile ux breakdown

* Looking for mobile app
* Created a new repo name `dsgn270-a1` on GH
* Cloned the repo to my local directory ->`git clone` https://github.com/maryambkhan/dsgn270-a1.git
* Added README.md file `git add .`
* Still thinking of good scenario to write user story
* I just figured out my user story
* I am going to write about `wallmart`
* I have created a rough sketch of my user story on paper
* Now I am going to add it to my repo `dsgn270-a1` 
* I just set `##H heading` and git add . ,git commit -m"" and git push as always no changes becouse i was not at right file 

Assessment:

* I have noticed i always forget to save code in vs
or i am always in wrong directory trying to `git add .` stuff
