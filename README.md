## jan 12,2022
* first try to write a journal.
* looking good.
* i created a repo named:codejournal and added file README.md by git add .
* i was not able to copy link to my terminal. 
* i asked for help from tony.
* then i made some changes init checked my status  using git status and then i pushed it to github by Git push.
* i thought it worked looks like im stuck
* omg i dont know what to do
* i forgot to save the file so git did not see any changes
* yea i got it
* just looked up for some basic syntax to make my journal pretty.
* i am hoping i don't make any mistakes there
* forgot to save again ahhhh
