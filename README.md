  ### Logo Design

     - I wanted crate a logo for photography website so this is what i colleted:
       ![MoodBoard](images/mood-board.PNG)

 - Ahhhh making logo is so hard i have tired to work on one image from my moodboard 
   i have got one done but i dont like it.
     
     ![Camera](images/prototype-1.PNG)

 - I have ideas what i want to do but implementation is hard.This was realy a challenge for me
 - Having problem using pen
 - Well i have got some messy work done but i think thats all i can do for now need more practice
 - I wanted to incoprate text with my logo just cant figure out how so i am going to proced to next step
  if i have time left will try that again

 - I tried to create 4 of these but this is what i could get
 - let's see my mood board 

  ![updated MoodBoard](images/updated-moodboard.PNG)

 - In my updated moodboard i have got image, its so silly idea i dont even know why i added this in there.
   while i was working on it just hit me so i just put in on canvas LOL
 - Ok time for  clean up and start coding
 - So i started exporting from figma i was having problem with `width and height` of the logo and i had too many paths so i used boolean groups. After that i had to change width and height in `svgomg` too. 
- When i was done with logo design then css styling was real simple
- Well great learning experience once i understood tools and little things it was preaty good to work on
- I am still having problem with image part it is not shrinking need check that out

### Figma Mockup

- I am working on `sephora's` website for mockup. I choose there website becouse they have 
   lots going on on there site it would be good for prototype assignment.
- I created a library where i set colors and fonts, I found colors from there site and set them as style
   but i couldint fint any font they are using so i just found somthing similar.

    ![Libray style](images/library.PNG)

- Now i am going to start working on designing the site.
- I have completed 2 nav bars (local and global) and i have put hero section image.
- It is looking good next i am working on product/card.
- I finished designing cards and already started working on footer.
- When i started working on footer i wanted to increase the length of card so i did that 
  when i scrolled up globel navigation was broken took me some time to fix it.
- I am almost done with footer and then my assignment will be done if no problem.

     ![Sephora Site Mockup](images/work-in-process.PNG)

### Figma Prototype

- I have copied the landing page from dsgn270-a4 and
   started new project dsgn270-a5.

- Plan:
    - Components:
        - Global nav-bar
        - Local nav-bar
        - Sign in button
        - Show more button
        - Card
- I have created a home page and atteched all the components to it
- Created second page Navigating to `new` page and this page has all the 
  available new products i wanted to add more products to it like when i click 
  see more then i can see more products but i cant figure out how to add two properties 
  to one component
- It looks clean and simple i like it, i CAN still see some silly mistakes
  need more practice but i this looks nice
- On third page `makeup` i posted cards with more makeup products and a poster with 
  call to action.
- I made more components on the way as i needed them `jessica's demo` helped me with creating these 
  little components and re using them.
- I wanted to go for simple design and make the site easy and accessable for user i tried to use more color
  to make site colorfull as it is a cosmetics website. I think did not overdo with the colors
- Mostly i wanted to use as much as  different prototype i could use
![Libray style](images/components.PNG)
- Creating nav bar was so hard i had to do same thing over and over so many time
  i wish i can find something easy then this
- It was real nice experience i liked it i learnend so much stuff mostly 
- How to start creating a website why we need to design a site.
